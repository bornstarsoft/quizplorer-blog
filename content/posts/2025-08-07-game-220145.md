MiHoYo has officially announced that support for the PS4 version of Genshin Impact will be discontinued by April 2026, citing hardware performance limitations and the growing size of the game as primary reasons. This decision marks a significant shift as the gaming industry moves towards more powerful platforms, leaving last-gen consoles behind.

The discontinuation will occur in three phases: starting with the removal of the game from the PlayStation Store on September 10, 2025, followed by the delisting of in-game purchases on February 25, 2026, and finally, the end of update support on April 8, 2026. Players are encouraged to transition to PS5 or other supported platforms to continue enjoying the game without interruptions.

As Genshin Impact evolves, it raises questions about the future of gaming on older consoles. Will we see more titles follow suit, or can developers find ways to optimize for last-gen hardware? The gaming landscape is changing rapidly, and it's essential to stay informed about these developments.

Square Enix has officially revealed that Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade will be the largest game on the Nintendo Switch 2, with a staggering file size of up to 99GB. This means that installing the game could take up nearly 40% of the console's available storage, which ships with 249GB. Such a significant storage requirement raises questions about how players will manage their game libraries on the new platform.

While other AAA titles on the Switch 2 have managed to keep their file sizes relatively smallerlike Hogwarts Legacy at 23GB and Cyberpunk 2077 at 57GBFinal Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade's size highlights the ambitious scope of this beloved RPG. Director Naoki Hamaguchi emphasized the importance of maintaining high-quality lighting in the game, ensuring that the Switch 2 version does not compromise on graphics quality, even if it runs at 30 frames per second.

As we look forward to the game's release on January 22, it will be interesting to see how players adapt to the storage demands of such a large title. Will this influence their purchasing decisions, or will the allure of a classic RPG outweigh the practical concerns of storage management?

In a surprising turn of events, Amazon Games has confirmed that its MMO, New World: Aeternum, will officially go offline on January 31, 2027. This announcement comes after the game was pulled from storefronts, marking a significant shift in Amazon's approach to MMO development. Players will no longer be able to purchase in-game currency starting July 20, 2026, and the game will be delisted from sales on January 15, 2026.

Despite the impending shutdown, players who have purchased New World will still be able to download and install the game until it is taken offline. Amazon expresses gratitude to the community for their dedication and passion, emphasizing the collaborative journey of crafting the world of Aeternum. The developers are committed to providing a memorable sendoff for the game, extending the Nighthaven season until the servers close.

As we reflect on this announcement, it raises questions about the future of MMOs in the gaming landscape. Will players find new adventures elsewhere, or does this signify a larger trend in the industry? Only time will tell as we approach the final year of New World: Aeternum.

In a recent interview, Naoki Hamaguchi, the director of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy, emphasized that the upcoming third installment will not compromise on quality despite being developed for multiple platforms, including the Xbox Series S and Switch 2. He reassured fans that the development structure is designed to ensure that each platform is optimized individually, maintaining high performance across the board.

Hamaguchi explained that the team prioritizes high-end specifications during development, scaling down for lower-end systems rather than the other way around. This thoughtful approach means that players on more powerful hardware can expect enhanced experiences, such as increased NPC density in towns, without sacrificing the quality of the game on less capable systems.

As the gaming community eagerly awaits the release, its clear that the commitment to quality remains paramount. Will this approach set a new standard for multiplatform game development?

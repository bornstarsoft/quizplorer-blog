In a startling revelation, November 2025 marked the worst month for hardware sales in the US since tracking began 30 years ago. According to Circana, only 1.6 million units of video game hardware were sold, a significant drop from previous years and the lowest since 1995. This decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including an all-time high average price of $439 for new units, which deterred many potential buyers during the typically lucrative Black Friday and Christmas shopping season.

The PlayStation 5 emerged as the best-selling console, followed closely by the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S. However, the overall spending on physical software also saw a sharp decline, falling 14% compared to November 2024, indicating a shift towards digital sales that are not captured in these figures. With the gaming market facing potential pricing challenges due to component costs, the future of dedicated gaming devices may be at a crossroads.

As we look ahead, it raises the question: how will console manufacturers adapt to these economic pressures while still appealing to gamers? The landscape of gaming is evolving, and it will be fascinating to see how these trends shape the industry in the coming months.

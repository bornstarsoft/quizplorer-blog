NINES has just unveiled their upcoming title, Pipeworks Puzzle, a game that promises to breathe new life into the classic tile sliding puzzle genre. Set against a backdrop of charming visuals and soothing tunes, this game invites players to step into the shoes of a plumber at a bustling construction site. The objective? To rearrange disordered pipe pieces according to a blueprint, ensuring a seamless connection throughout the grid-based arena.

What sets Pipeworks Puzzle apart is not just its engaging gameplay but also the inclusion of a supportive character named 'Boss', designed by the talented PokuriMio. This character will guide players from novice to master plumber, making the journey enjoyable and accessible for all skill levels. With features like an endless mode and a speedrun option on the horizon, there's plenty for players to look forward to.

Currently, Pipeworks Puzzle can be wishlisted on Steam, and doing so may unlock exciting new features, including a multiplayer battle mode and even a cat companion! A demo is also on the way, so be sure to keep an eye on the Steam page for updates. As we await its release later this year, one can't help but wonder how this innovative twist on a familiar format will resonate with puzzle enthusiasts around the globe.

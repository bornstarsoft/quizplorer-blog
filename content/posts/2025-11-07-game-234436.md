In a significant turn of events, Bad Brain Game Studios, a subsidiary of NetEase, has announced its impending closure due to unsuccessful attempts to secure a new partner for its project, Midnight Riders. This decision underscores the challenges faced by game developers in an increasingly competitive landscape, where securing partnerships can be as crucial as the creative process itself.

Studio head Sean Cooks expressed gratitude for the support received from NetEase, highlighting the team's dedication and creativity throughout their journey. Despite their efforts, the studio will cease operations on November 17th, 2025, leaving behind a project that still holds potential for future development. The underlying IP of Midnight Riders remains available for acquisition, inviting other publishers or studios to consider its future.

As we reflect on this closure, it raises important questions about the sustainability of game studios in today's market. Will we see more developers facing similar fates, or will this serve as a wake-up call for the industry to foster stronger partnerships?

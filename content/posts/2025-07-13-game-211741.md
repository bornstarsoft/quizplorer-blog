Indie horror game Haus Of Irndrous is currently available for free on Steam, but this offer won't last long. Developed by Yxtopia Studios, this atmospheric horror title is transitioning to a paid model on July 19, 2025, with a price tag of $1.99. This means that players have just a few days left to add this intriguing game to their libraries at no cost.

Originally launched as an early access title in August 2024, Haus Of Irndrous was designed to be episodic, with the first chapter being free while subsequent episodes were planned as paid content. The shift to a paid model aims to support the development of future chapters and enhance server capabilities, according to Yxtopia Studios. With the recent update 17.0, players can expect improved enemy AI and performance optimizations, setting the stage for future expansions.

As the gaming community eagerly anticipates the next chapters, this transition raises questions about how indie developers can balance funding and player engagement. Will you be claiming your free copy before the deadline? Let's see how this unfolds for Yxtopia Studios and their horror experience!

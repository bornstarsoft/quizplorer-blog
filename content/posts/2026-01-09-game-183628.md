Xbox and Obsidians action RPG, Avowed, is set to make a significant impact on the gaming landscape with its upcoming release on PlayStation 5 next month. This marks a pivotal moment in Microsofts strategy of expanding its gaming portfolio across multiple platforms, showcasing a shift in how games are developed and distributed. The PS5 version will launch alongside an anniversary update on February 17, introducing exciting features like New Game Plus mode, new races, and a Photo Mode.

Set in the richly crafted world of Eora, which fans first encountered in the Pillars of Eternity franchise, Avowed has been praised for its engaging narrative and immersive gameplay. The recent review from VGC highlights the game as a solid action RPG that delivers satisfying combat and detailed environments, despite some frustrations with side quests. As Obsidian continues to innovate with titles like The Outer Worlds 2 and Grounded 2, the gaming community eagerly anticipates how Avowed will evolve on the PS5.

With the gaming industry constantly evolving, it will be fascinating to see how players respond to Avowed's new features and whether it can carve out its own identity in the competitive RPG market. Are you excited to dive back into the world of Eora?

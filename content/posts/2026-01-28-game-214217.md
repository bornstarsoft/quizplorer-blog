Highguard, the newly launched free-to-play shooter, has made waves by attracting nearly 100,000 concurrent players on its first day. However, this impressive figure is tempered by a staggering 13,000 negative reviews on Steam, raising questions about the game's overall quality and player satisfaction. With only 32.05% of reviews being positive, it's clear that while the player count is high, the reception is anything but.

The game's launch follows a significant reveal at The Game Awards, a slot typically reserved for major franchises. Developed by Wildlight Entertainment, which boasts veterans from popular titles like Apex Legends and Call of Duty, Highguard's ambitious entry into the market has been met with mixed feelings. Players have criticized the expansive map size, claiming it detracts from the fast-paced action expected in 3v3 matchups.

As the gaming community reflects on Highguard's debut, it raises an important question: can a game with such a strong start overcome its early criticism, or will it struggle to maintain its player base? Only time will tell if Wildlight Entertainment can address player concerns and turn the tide of public opinion.

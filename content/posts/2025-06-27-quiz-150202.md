Capcom's latest reveal of Pragmata has gamers buzzing with excitement, especially with its innovative blend of puzzle-solving and shooting mechanics. The recently showcased gameplay video highlights a unique approach where players must hack robots through a mini-game while simultaneously engaging in combat. This dual-layered gameplay promises to deliver a fresh experience that challenges both strategic thinking and reflexes.

Set in a near-future lunar research station, Pragmata introduces players to Hugh, a combat-ready spaceman, and his enigmatic android companion, Diana. The game's narrative and setting are as intriguing as its mechanics, offering a rich backdrop for exploration and adventure. Despite its delays since the initial announcement in June 2020, early impressions from media previews suggest that Pragmata is shaping up to be a polished and engaging title.

As we look ahead to its release in 2026, the anticipation builds around how Capcom will expand on these innovative ideas throughout the game's extensive playtime. Will Pragmata redefine the puzzle-shooter genre, or will it struggle to maintain its unique charm over the long haul? Only time will tell.

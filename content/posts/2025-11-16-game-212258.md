The Tokyo Monorail is set to launch an engaging real-world puzzle game in collaboration with Little Twin Stars, running from November 14, 2025, to February 28, 2026. This unique event invites participants to explore the scenic monorail route while solving ciphers and decoding messages from the beloved mascot, Monorun. With two beginner-friendly routes, this experience promises to be both fun and accessible for all ages.

Participants can purchase a kit that includes a drawstring pouch, a puzzle booklet, and exclusive tenant discount coupons for just 2,000 yen. The first 1,000 to join will receive a special ballpoint pen charm, and those who complete both routes will be rewarded with a bonus smartphone wallpaper. This initiative not only enhances the travel experience but also celebrates the 50th anniversary of Little Twin Stars with a dedicated photo spot at Haneda Airport.

As we look forward to this innovative blend of travel and gaming, one can't help but wonder: how will such interactive experiences shape the future of tourism and engagement in urban environments?

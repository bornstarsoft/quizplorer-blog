The gaming industry is buzzing with excitement as the developers behind *Lies of P* celebrate a significant sales milestone, surpassing 3 million copies sold. This achievement has not only brought financial success but also generous rewards for the team at Round8 Studio and Neowiz. Each developer will receive a bonus of 10 million South Korean won (approximately $7,300), along with two weeks of paid vacation and a Nintendo Switch 2 console. Such recognition highlights the importance of rewarding talent in the competitive gaming landscape.

The success of *Lies of P*, along with its DLC *Overture*, showcases the game's strong reception among players, despite the fact that many accessed it through Xbox Game Pass. The innovative approach to gameplay, including the introduction of varied difficulty levels, has been praised for potentially attracting a broader audience to the Soulslike genre. As the team prepares for a sequel, these rewards serve as a motivating reminder of the impact their hard work has on players worldwide.

As we look ahead, it will be fascinating to see how the success of *Lies of P* influences future game development strategies and player engagement. Will other studios follow suit in recognizing and rewarding their teams for hitting significant milestones?

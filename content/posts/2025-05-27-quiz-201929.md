In a daring move, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced their upcoming game, *ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard*, boldly claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This statement not only highlights the absence of a third installment in the beloved *Portal* series but also sets high expectations for their new puzzle game. With *Portal 2* being a benchmark in the genre, the pressure is on for *ChromaGun 2* to deliver an engaging experience that resonates with fans of the original.

While the gameplay mechanics of *ChromaGun 2* draw comparisons to *Portal*, they also evoke memories of other puzzle games like *Qube* and *Qube 2*. Players will utilize a unique gun to manipulate colors and solve puzzles, reminiscent of the colorful blocks found in these titles. The game’s setting, involving a company testing new technology, adds a layer of intrigue, though it appears to be less sinister than Aperture Science's infamous testing chambers.

With a free demo available on Steam, players can get a taste of what *ChromaGun 2* has to offer before its full release. Given that the original *ChromaGun* received 'Mostly Positive' reviews upon its launch in 2016, there’s reason to be optimistic about this sequel. As we look forward to its release, the question remains: can *ChromaGun 2* carve its own niche while honoring the legacy of *Portal*?

According to the latest State of the Game Industry survey by the Game Developers Conference (GDC), developers are showing a clear preference for creating games on the PS5 and the upcoming Switch 2 over the Xbox Series X/S. The survey, which gathered insights from over 2,300 industry professionals, revealed that only 20% of respondents expressed interest in developing for Xbox, compared to 40% for PS5 and 39% for Switch 2. This stark contrast highlights a significant shift in developer sentiment towards Microsofts console.

The survey also indicated that while 80% of developers are keen on PC game development, the interest in Xbox is now on par with mobile platforms like Android and iOS. This change in attitude is noteworthy, especially considering that 40% of respondents reported their last project was released on Xbox. With Xbox's strategy evolving towards a multiplatform approach, it will be interesting to see how this affects their game releases in the coming years.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, the question remains: will Xbox be able to regain developer interest, or will the trend towards PS5 and Switch 2 persist?

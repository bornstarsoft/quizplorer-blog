BitSummit 2025 is set to be a landmark event in the indie gaming community, showcasing an impressive lineup of 120 games from Japan and around the globe. Scheduled to take place from July 19 to July 21 at the Miyako Messe in Kyoto, this year's theme, "Summer of Yokai," pays homage to Japan's rich folklore, promising a unique experience for attendees. With over 38,000 participants last year, the expo has grown significantly since its inception in 2012, reflecting the increasing interest in indie games.

The event is not just a platform for developers to showcase their work; itâ€™s a celebration of creativity and innovation in the gaming industry. John Davis, co-founder of the Japan Independent Games Aggregate (JIGA), expressed excitement over the diverse submissions received this year, emphasizing the importance of community and collaboration in indie game development.

The gaming world is buzzing with excitement as Monstars Inc., the studio behind the acclaimed Tetris Effect: Connected, has announced their latest project: Lumines Arise. Set to launch this fall on PlayStation 5, PlayStation VR, and PC via Steam, this new title promises to deliver a captivating blend of music and puzzle gameplay that aims to engage players on multiple sensory levels.

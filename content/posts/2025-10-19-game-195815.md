After two decades of anticipation, the legendary game Infinity is set to make its long-awaited debut on the Game Boy Color in Q4 of 2025. This tactical RPG, originally developed by Affinix Software, showcases a unique strategic battle system and an engaging plot that has captured the hearts of retro gaming enthusiasts. With its release just in time for the holidays, Infinity promises to be a nostalgic treat for fans and newcomers alike.

Originally canceled in 2002 due to market conditions, Infinity saw a resurgence in interest when an unfinished version was released as a free ROM in 2016. The games revival was further propelled by a successful crowdfunding campaign led by Incube8 Games in 2021, which allowed them to acquire the rights and bring this once-abandoned gem back to life. With over 30 explorable areas, five playable characters, and stunning 8-bit graphics, Infinity is poised to deliver an immersive experience that honors its retro roots.

As we look forward to its release, its exciting to think about how Infinity will resonate with the gaming community. Will this revival inspire more developers to revisit and complete unfinished classics? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: Infinity on Game Boy Color is a monumental comeback in the world of retro gaming!

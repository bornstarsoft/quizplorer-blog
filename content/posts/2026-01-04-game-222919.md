This is the first multi-platform NASCAR game since 2021, and it brings a wealth of options for players, showcasing a variety of drivers and their unique styles. The inclusion of the ARCA Menards Series alongside the three NASCAR National Series has further enriched the game, offering a nostalgic yet fresh experience for gamers.

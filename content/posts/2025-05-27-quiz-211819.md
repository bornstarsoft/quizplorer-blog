In a bold move that has caught the attention of gamers worldwide, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced their upcoming title, **ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard**, claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This audacious statement sets the stage for a game that aims to fill the void left by Valve's reluctance to produce a third installment in the beloved Portal series. With a free demo available on Steam, players can get a taste of what this colorful puzzler has to offer.

While the game draws comparisons to Portal, particularly in its setting where players assist a company in testing new technology, the gameplay mechanics seem to align more closely with titles like **Qube** and **Qube 2**. Players will utilize a unique gun to manipulate colors and solve puzzles, which, while reminiscent of Portal's innovative design, introduces a fresh take on the puzzle genre. The original ChromaGun, released in 2016, received 'Mostly Positive' reviews, raising expectations for this sequel.

As the gaming community eagerly anticipates the release of ChromaGun 2, itâ€™s exciting to see indie developers stepping up to deliver experiences that challenge the status quo. Will Pixel Maniacs successfully capture the magic of Portal while carving out its own identity? Only time will tell, but for now, the demo is a must-try for puzzle enthusiasts.

In a bold move that has caught the attention of gamers everywhere, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced their upcoming title, *ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard*, claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This statement not only highlights the long-standing desire for a true sequel to *Portal 2*, but it also sets high expectations for a game that aims to fill those iconic shoes. With the original *ChromaGun* receiving 'Mostly Positive' reviews since its release in 2016, anticipation is building for what this sequel will bring to the table.

While the game’s visuals and setting may evoke memories of *Portal*, the gameplay mechanics appear to draw more inspiration from titles like *Qube* and *Qube 2*. Players will utilize a unique gun to manipulate colors and solve puzzles, steering away from the portal mechanics that defined Valve's classic. This fresh approach could resonate well with fans of the genre looking for innovative puzzle-solving experiences. Plus, with a free demo available on Steam, players can dive into the action and see if *ChromaGun 2* lives up to its ambitious claims.

As we look ahead to the release of *ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard*, it raises an interesting question: can indie developers successfully capture the essence of beloved franchises while forging their own identities? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure—this sequel is already making waves in the gaming community.

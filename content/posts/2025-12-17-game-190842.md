The recent revelation from Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke has taken the gaming world by storm: neither PlayStation nor Xbox were aware of the new Divinity game until its surprise announcement at The Game Awards. This level of secrecy underscores the studio's commitment to keeping their projects under wraps, a feat that is increasingly rare in the gaming industry.

Vincke explained that the platforms were completely in the dark about the games existence, which adds an exciting twist to the reveal. The anticipation surrounding the next installment in the beloved Divinity series is palpable, especially after the success of Baldurs Gate 3, which won multiple awards at the same event. As the gaming community eagerly awaits more details, the question remains: how will Larian navigate the conversations with console makers now that the cat is out of the bag?

With the tagline, "The gods are silent. Rivellon bleeds. New powers stir," the new game promises to build on the rich lore and gameplay mechanics that fans have come to love. As we look forward to more updates, its clear that Larian Studios is poised to deliver another groundbreaking RPG experience.

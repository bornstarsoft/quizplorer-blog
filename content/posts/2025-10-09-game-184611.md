Nintendo Switch Online has just made a significant addition to its SNES library by introducing three classic titles, including the long-awaited Mario & Wario, which marks the first official release of this Japanese Mario game outside of Japan. This addition not only expands the nostalgic offerings for gamers but also highlights Nintendo's commitment to preserving and sharing its rich gaming history.

Mario & Wario, originally developed by Game Freak before their Pokmon fame, is a unique puzzle platformer that utilizes the Super Famicom Mouse. Players guide Mario through challenging levels while overcoming obstacles placed by Wario. The inclusion of this game, along with Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind and Fatal Fury Special, brings the total number of SNES titles available in the West to 77, showcasing Nintendo's dedication to diversifying its classic game library.

As we look forward to more classic titles being added to the Nintendo Switch Online service, it raises the question: which other hidden gems from gaming history would you like to see make a comeback? Let's hope Nintendo continues to surprise us with more iconic releases in the future!

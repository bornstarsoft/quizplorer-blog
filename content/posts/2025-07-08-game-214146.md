Romero Games clarified that they are not shutting down and are committed to reassessing their staffing and project status. The studio emphasized their ongoing discussions with potential partners, aiming to revive their canceled project.

Will they find the support needed to bring their vision to life? Only time will tell, but the community's support could play a crucial role in their journey forward.

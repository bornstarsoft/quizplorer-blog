In a recent interview, Yasumi Matsuno, the writer behind the beloved Final Fantasy Tactics series, revealed that the upcoming remaster, The Ivalice Chronicles, will feature significant tweaks to its original script. However, these changes are not influenced by modern sensibilities or current events, but rather aim to enhance the gameplay experience while preserving the essence of the original 1997 title.

Matsuno explained that the adjustments are designed to support a new voice acting implementation, shifting the focus to a ‘listening-first’ approach. This means that while the text will be updated for clarity and flow, the core narrative remains intact, allowing both new players and long-time fans to enjoy the game in a fresh format. Notably, for purists, a ‘Classic Version’ will also be available, combining the original graphics and gameplay with a well-regarded translation.

As we look forward to the release on September 30th, it’s exciting to see how these changes will resonate with fans. Will the new script enhance the storytelling experience, or will the classic version reign supreme in the hearts of loyal players? Only time will tell.

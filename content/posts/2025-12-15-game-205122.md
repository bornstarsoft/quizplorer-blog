In an exciting turn of events for retro gaming enthusiasts, the long-lost NES puzzle game Xcavator, developed by Chris Oberth in 1991, is set to make its debut as a polished cartridge edition. This revival is the result of a collaboration between iam8bit and the Video Game History Foundation, showcasing the importance of preserving gaming history. Priced at $100, this release not only offers an authentic NES cartridge but also includes a detailed manual that delves into the game's troubled past and Oberths career.

The resurrection of Xcavator highlights the broader challenges faced in preserving 8-bit history, a task that is often overlooked in the fast-paced world of modern gaming. With profits supporting the Video Game History Foundation's archival efforts, this release serves as a reminder of the rich tapestry of video game development and the stories that deserve to be told. As we look forward to the 2025 release, one can't help but wonder what other hidden gems from gaming's past are waiting to be unearthed. Will we see more collaborations like this in the future?

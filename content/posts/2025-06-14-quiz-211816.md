In a bold move that has sent shockwaves through the gaming community, Microsoft has announced that Obsidian Entertainment's upcoming title, *The Outer Worlds 2*, will be the first Xbox game to carry an $80 price tag. This decision comes on the heels of Nintendo's controversial pricing strategy with *Mario Kart World*, raising questions about the future of game pricing in an industry already grappling with consumer expectations and corporate greed.

During the recent Xbox Games Showcase 2025, Obsidian unveiled a new trailer and a behind-the-scenes presentation, humorously highlighting the game's satirical take on capitalism. However, the irony of launching a game that critiques corporate excess at such a high price point has not gone unnoticed. Fans have taken to social media and gaming forums to express their disbelief and frustration, with many questioning the value of the game and the implications of this pricing trend.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, the reaction to *The Outer Worlds 2*'s pricing could serve as a bellwether for how consumers respond to perceived corporate greed in the gaming industry. Will this lead to a broader backlash against high-priced games, or will players continue to support titles regardless of cost? Only time will tell.

Nintendo has unveiled exciting details about the upcoming update for Animal Crossing: New Horizons, set to launch on January 15, 2026. This free update will introduce four new villagers inspired by the beloved Legend of Zelda and Splatoon franchises, and players can unlock them by scanning specific amiibo figures. This feature not only enhances the gameplay experience but also adds a layer of strategy for collectors and fans alike.

The new villagers include Tulin and Mineru from the Legend of Zelda series, as well as Cece and Vich from Splatoon. Each character can be unlocked by scanning designated amiibo, which means that players will need to be strategic about which amiibo they collect to access their favorite characters. This approach encourages community interaction and trading among players, as some amiibo may unlock the same character.

As we look forward to this update, it's clear that Nintendo continues to innovate and engage its audience by blending nostalgia with new content. How will you prepare your island for the arrival of these new villagers?
